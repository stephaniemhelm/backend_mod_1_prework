## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
For me, it depends on the question.  In the section1 exercises, I was unsure of how to move my git commits to GitHub.  We had not yet learned that so I was fairly certain that other's might have the same question.  I posted it to slack and someone helped me.  I think it helped others as well.
However, I am more hesitant to ask if I think I am the only one with the question.  If I feel it is something I should know and everyone else knows, I am hesitant to ask.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
an `if_statement` is a conditional statement.
```
if weather == "cold"
  puts "wear a coat"
else weather == "hot"
  puts "leave your coat at home"
end
```
```
if dogs > cats
  puts "we have more dogs than cats"
else cats > dogs
  puts "we have more cats than dogs"
end  
```
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
an if statement tells ruby line by line what to execute.  
if the first statement is true, it will print the puts statement.
if statement is false, it will move to the next statement.
it will go through each statement until it finds one that is true.  
if none of the statements are true, it will print nothing.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if
  puts ""
else
  puts ""
end
```
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement? `elsif`

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if
  puts ""
elsif
  puts ""
elsif
  puts ""
elsif
  puts ""
else
  puts ""
end
```


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
