## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    * Growth mindset vs fixed mindset.   In a fixed mindset we believe that our capabilities are fixed.  In a growth mindset we know that life is a continual learning process.
    * When I am facing a problem or struggling: 1) make a mental list, what am I ACTUALLY struggling with, 2) turn it into a plan with action steps.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by learning coding with Turing.  This is absolutely new to me but I know that I can continue to learn.  For me it takes time and practice.  

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
